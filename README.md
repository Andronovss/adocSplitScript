# adocSplitScript

This repository contains a python script that splits one large adoc or md file into multiple files.

The splitting of the source file is based on the headings.

There are two extensions supported: *md* && *adoc*.

You can choose right file extension and file format via CLI.

Usage:

```ps
python script.py input.adoc --format adoc
```

Alternate run method:

Copy the repository to your drive:

```ps
git clone https://github.com/Andronovss/adocSplitScript.git
```

The dist directory contains the file **gui.exe**, which is a windowed application.

The directories **_sound** and **_icons**, and the **script.py** file are required for runtime.

Execute the gui.exe file from the same location as the above objects.
